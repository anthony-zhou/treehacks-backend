       " \"INTERVIEWER:\\nI think we were a second to last. I think we were team number 11 and now we were team number four last week. I bet we're much higher this week, but they didn't rank us this week, which is unfortunate.\",\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWER:\\nSo they're like, there's some doofuses.\",\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWER:\\nOh, you didn't? Okay. So apparently during the team debrief on Monday. So according to the team debrief, so apparently all the partners, basically like Anne, Michael, whatever the fuck, Mike and all those people, they talk about each team. They're on Monday on the Monday meetings. And apparently we're called the Dark Horse team. The literal like the what is it called? I think we have like a spy in Fuggate that helps us because we're friends with Sasha and like kind of just tell this like. Who? What is Sasha's role again? She's an intern that manages the operations of Fuggate, this particular reactor group. So it's just say apparently Dark Horse is a candidate or competitor about whom little is known, but who unexpectedly wins or succeeds.\",\n",
       " 'INTERVIEWER:\\nNo.',\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWER:\\nI'm feeling like I can do it. Man, get on this fucking grind. I have an option seven. Also, some quick updates about like what Fuggate is thinking. The AND meeting went pretty well. They're kind of pushing us to build some shit. I think. So basically the AND meeting went pretty well. I think Tyler's almost completely convinced of our thesis. Did I talk about the Dark Horse thing?\",\n",
       " 'INTERVIEWER:\\nAnd you could implement their own internal mobility tool just by doing that. Also, we have two interviews coming up in the next hour. Yes. Is Zach on any of them? Or are you feeling interviewee today?',\n",
       " 'INTERVIEWER:\\nWhich is kind of, you know, what I found kind of interesting is that like, actually this system actually reductively becomes a internal mobility tool. Because like, imagine you made an external mobility tool, but you made all your close friends only people within your organization.',\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWER:\\nYeah, it's almost like a paradox because a company might buy into the narrative that like, hey, external mobility is going to help us be able to turn this recruiter into a profit center. And if that's the narrative they bought into, then sort of implementing internal mobility. Maybe push it to them in tandem, you know.\",\n",
       " 'INTERVIEWER:\\nYes, it might be that starts external and then you give them internal.',\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWER:\\nI don't, there's definitely something to be reconciled about a platform that supports both internal mobility and external mobility. Because both are good when combined to a degree of modernity in the job market like it helps people, you know, find their role the fastest at the same time. Huge conflict of interest. You would, you would, I think, lose an aspect of corporal support when you implement external mobility features, once you've given them internal mobility features.\",\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWER:\\nYes, I think it does exist, it does exist. But like the idea behind what we can do is we can also allow them to push out of network. Like if it doesn't work in network, we can push it out of network. But then again, that might have issues because then people like oh, if nobody in the company wanted them, why would I want them? Who knows? We'll see. Yeah, but it's just to say, I still feel very confident in this, like this product. This project.\",\n",
       " 'INTERVIEWER:\\nI feel like that exists with being marine.',\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWER:\\nYeah, it seems like it's just up to opinions, which is kind of interesting. Let's see. Okay, that's interesting. I'm just like, I was just thinking about how how recruiter evaluated how we give bonuses to them because I want to know if there's even internal incentive alignment. I think what I realized after talking to all these people is that they also want an internal talent marketplace, like something that we could do is that we can make it so everybody or every recruiter and organization is in their own little bubble by default in a workspace.\",\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWER:\\nIt's not very mathy. It's very people. Right. Because I'm guessing their bosses a CHRO. So, it would almost feel like, like if you were tight with the manager, not just innocent like oh you climb with her but isn't like, oh you, you know, oh, we should have been like hi, we're also climbers but also, it's like if you have a good relationship with a good recruiter by being what they consider a good recruiter, then you're basically good.\",\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWER:\\nSo, yeah, actually, I learned a lot from that. What I realized is that the way the technical people are assessed is completely different from the way that recruiters are assessed. In fact, I would say a lot of recruiters are assessed on qualitative data, like basically like subjective like, oh, here's this this this and even this company that's 2000 people, their assessment is like, not very like hard.\",\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWER:\\nSo, thoughts on if you're able to ask the questions if you wanted to ask. We mean, oh, I say thoughts on if you were able to ask the questions you wanted to ask.\",\n",
       " 'INTERVIEWEE:\\nNo, I love the bit. Of course, if you need anything, just let me know and good luck on your project. Sounds good. Thank you so much.',\n",
       " 'INTERVIEWER:\\nPerfect.',\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWER:\\nFor the spite of information you've given us and I want to stay mindful of the 1130. Yes.\",\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWEE:\\nYeah, it would be nice to do that. Right. Like everyone wants to do that. Everyone sometimes thinks like it would be great to just eliminate recruiting and what a cost saving it would be. But if you really think about it like there has to be a human element to it because if you get especially with all the scams and things that go on in this world. So think about it from this perspective. I would say like if you guys were applying for a job when you graduate and you never actually spoke with anyone until you started or until you started your onboarding paperwork. How do you know that it's a legit company? First and foremost, like you've never spoken with anyone. How do you know the true culture of the company at this point? I think there is ways to automate. Like I think there's a lot of ways that could be enhanced, like a lot more self scheduling automation and a lot more like email, different pieces that can go through. But I think that what wins people into companies is what they experienced through the recruitment onboarding process. I've had at least five candidates in the last month to tell me that they wouldn't have joined 09 if it wasn't for our recruitment process because they selected us over other companies because we were the people that responded the fastest communicated the best and was transparent with them throughout. And I think that makes the difference in why someone would select us over our competitors.\",\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWER:\\nSo what we realize is that like any solutions or any any sort of products that we build have to be with people in mind and people need people. That was like a revelation for me personally. It's like a coder guy.\",\n",
       " 'INTERVIEWEE:\\nYeah, you happen to do that.',\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWER:\\nGotcha. Well, I mean something that we were initially thinking like we're all technical people with technical backgrounds. Before we started talking to people we're like, oh, we just should automate the entire recruiters out of the process. And after we start talking to recruiters, we're like, oh, hell no. This is like,\",\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWEE:\\nYes. A good question. For me I'm someone who is probably more transparent than most managers. I think that being transparent and I'm like that with candidates too because I think transparency is key. But I'm very hands off but hands on with my employees. So the way that I manage is essentially I do have weekly one on ones that with my team and we talk through what challenges and successes that they're having. If they make a mistake we talk through that mistake. It's not an automatic counseling or anything. It's just like oh hey you know you made a mistake. Here's what you can do to improve. If that continues to happen then we have more direct conversations where I'm like hey we talked about this five minute five times already. I'm going to start documenting it because you are missing X Y Z and there's been no room for improvement. If this doesn't continue then I'll start the documentation process. So I give them a heads up before I ever start that process anyways and I think that's what's different. I think some managers will start that process after the second or third time and not give a heads up. They'll just say hey you're not doing X Y Z and they'll start documenting and move forward that process. I don't do that so I don't necessarily have as much turnover on my team or performance management issues on my team because I have flexibility with my team too. Like I don't care what time they start working. I don't care what time they end their day as long as they're performing and meeting their expectations and deadlines with the hiring managers and hiring teams. So I really lead by getting feedback from my team on how I can better assist them understanding what they need. Some of my employees will need me to meet with them two times a week or some of my employees want to change our weekly to a biweekly because that's more efficient for them with other meetings that they have going on and I'm flexible and adapt to those pieces as long as we're performing. If we're not performing then that's where I pull in a little bit more and I become more hands on and more focused and and so forth. But we work together as a team. It's more of a partnership than meeting their leader. It's more of a we work together as a team. How can we support each other?\",\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWER:\\nOh yeah. I was going to say because I've been listening to some human resource podcast recently and I've been just curious about personal differences in leadership philosophy. So something about your role that I'm seeing feels like you know there's certainly a huge management element to it. I was just wondering kind of like what is your way of leading like efficient quality hiring and what what kind of sets your leadership apart in that.\",\n",
       " 'INTERVIEWER:\\nGotcha. And Michelle had a really good question about the leadership. I kind of forgot it.',\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWEE:\\nSo it's like the conversion on all those. Interesting. Now if you talk to like high volume people or agency, they may be looking at how many phone calls have went out. They may be looking at how many submissions there are too but they're going to be more so looking at like how many people are you calling? How many people have you emailed? How many people here? How many people? So there are recruiting teams that are a little bit more heavy metric driven where we're not as focused on the number of how many people you're speaking to. We're more concerned with the quality of hires that we're making and retaining at the company.\",\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWER:\\nGotcha. So it's from what I hear like the most quantitative metrics would be like the number of people in the number of people hired and the number of people who accept it.\",\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWEE:\\nYeah, there is some subjective pieces. However, we do have metrics that a lot of recruiters as a whole, especially us, we're looking at our time to fill. We're looking at how many submissions we've submitted. So like how like and we look at time to fill to understand, not as a metric to be like we have to get shorter timeframes. It's sometimes that is for like our interview process is too long. Let's cut this down because this is how fast we like. We're losing talent because we're going too slow. We utilize those metrics. But we also look at how many people were submitting to the hiring team. We're looking at diversity and inclusion. How many diverse candidates are we submitting in as a whole? And if we're not, why aren't we? What do we need to do to change that? We look at metrics as far as how many people accept our offers to decline and why is that so we can improve it on our end as a company as a whole. So there are a lot of different metrics that we look at. But the big ones for us is our diversity inclusion, because it's something we're ramping up here at 09. It's also are essentially like looking at how fast or how slow we're filling roles so we can improve the process for the candidate and also be able to bring in better talent faster. But qualifying and then essentially how many people we are submitting over to the team and how much we're not like. And why is that? Is it because the talent pool is very minimal? And then we go look at reports and we pull different research data that shows us like we're trying to hire for a purple squirrel and there's only about 3% within this area. Let's expand our area or we need to reduce the requirements of the position. We look at different requirements, I mean different metrics like that.\",\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWER:\\nCool. Yeah, I guess the other question is about these specific recruiters, like differentiating being strong and like mediocre recruiter. It's like, do you have any like, I think when you all do like an end of your review, do you have any like qualitative or quantitative metrics? Do you all do to maybe assign bonuses or some like promotions or whatnot? Or is it more subjective?\",\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWEE:\\nYeah. If you have a really strong, good recruiter, it will happen. If you have a mediocre recruiter that does a really good job, but is there to do a job, it's probably not going to happen as much. I see.\",\n",
       " 'INTERVIEWER:\\nSo it kind of depends on like the culture of the recruiting.',\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWEE:\\nI do. Yeah. I say five to 10 percent of the time as a whole for recruitment as an industry, because it depends on the recruiter from an in-house perspective. Some just decide that after they do their job, they're going home unless there's like a great candidate. So let me take that back. Sharing within. So sharing talent within the company happens a lot. So if I have a role and then let's say John Doe over here, I'm just making up a recruiter name. That's yeah. Then I could say, hey, this candidate looks like they're actually a better fit for your role. The team didn't want to move forward because of X, Y, Z. And we will interject internally. But from an external perspective, yes, I have a network of friends who will reach out to me and say, hey, I'm struggling on this role. Do you know of any candidates? And I'll go through candidates that I've reviewed and be like, you know, I may have a few. Let me see if they're available for me to share contact information. And then I reach back out to those people and say, hey, would you be comfortable with this? And vice versa. I will reach out to other recruiters and say I'm struggling on this role. Would you have any insight on talent? That could be a good fit and they'll do the same thing. So that does happen pretty frequently, but it does depend on the recruiter. So for me, it happens a lot for my team. I would say it probably happens a lot. But I've also worked in other industries and with other recruiters, and that doesn't necessarily happen as a whole.\",\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWER:\\nNo, we do not. I'm extremely curious because when you're saying that it's not so often in in-house recruiting to share candidates, something that we were kind of getting feedback on is when people have their own like trust and network of maybe other recruiters or people in the hiring space, they might talk to each other about, you know, once you have that kind of report with somebody, you trust their judgment on people. Do you tend to tap into those kind of networks or contribute to that?\",\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWEE:\\nI am good until 1130 if you guys have more questions. I'm happy to answer anything else. Or we can jump if you have another call.\",\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWER:\\nGotcha. Well, as we're coming out on time, I'm sure you have another meeting to prepare for.\",\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWEE:\\nIt does happen with strong candidates. So I will I mean, I've reached out to it doesn't happen like very like it happens frequently for certain recruiters, especially agency recruiters. So let me take this back. In-house recruiters won't do that. Agent received recruiters will share information with other companies because they're working with other companies. So they'll say, hey, I have this candidate and gives a brief overview. And then if they agree to speak with them, they'll reach out to that candidate and ask if they can share their name and contact details and move forward from there. So if you're looking at agencies and RPOs, which is recruitment outsource process agencies, then they will share with multiple companies. If you're talking about an in-house agent and not in-house agency, an in-house corporate recruiting team like myself, we would not share our information, any candidate information with other companies. I may tell someone, hey, I had a great candidate. Let me reach out to them. And then I'll reach out to that candidate and say, hey, I know it didn't work out at 09. I have a friend that's recruiting for this role. I think you could be a good fit. Can I connect the two of you? That does happen more frequently than not. But I would say it's probably it depends on the recruiter. So if I was to put a percentage to it, I could see it happening 5 percent, 10 percent of the time, depending on who you're working with and how great that candidate is. But it happens very frequently with agencies because they're working with multiple companies.\",\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWER:\\nI see. And from a personal level, I definitely understand, especially with what you're saying, building relationship and such, to forward someone's information for a role that you think they might be good at. So, you know, generally, does this phenomenon occur somewhat frequently in your experience?\",\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWEE:\\nYou're not allowed to do that. It's against the law. It's a confidentiality breach without asking the candidate first. So you could ask the candidate like, hey, this role didn't work out, but I have a friend who's hiring this. Would you be OK with me sharing your contact details with them? And if they state yes, then we can. But if a candidate applies internally to someone's company, they should not be sharing it outside, because when someone applies, we're saying that we're keeping this information internal for you. And that is the way it is legally supposed to happen.\",\n",
       " 'INTERVIEWER:\\nGotcha. And I guess the last question that we have time for is like, do you ever share these candidates with like other companies or other HR professionals?',\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWEE:\\nYes, ideally that doesn't happen at every company, but yes, there is a record that's kept. Now, what I will say is you can't necessarily keep people in the system too long, depending on what location you're in, because there are GDPR rules in other countries, and then in the US there's OFCCP. So in the US we can retain application details a little bit longer, but if you're like in Europe or other countries, you have to remove candidate data after a year, and then you have to also give them the ability in any place really to be able to delete their data as well. So candidates can have the option to ask you to remove their data or to opt out of you retaining whatever details. Depending on the location. So for us, we do have that detail though. So for candidates that are active and are within the platform that we're retaining their information on, we retain the data of the interview notes and feedback that the hiring team completed, and then we do our best to make sure that we put a little bit more depth in there on the reasoning why we didn't move forward with someone. Sometimes it is kind of a typical like, did not meet the qualifications or someone more qualified was selected, but a good recruiter does notate. Didn't move forward with them, nothing wrong with the profile, just XYZ from the other candidate. So that way it's good to re-circle back to. A lot of recruiters will add people on LinkedIn and stay up to date with them and interact with them on their feeds as well. But yes, like if I left and one of my recruiters seen a candidate that had been in my process, they'd be able to look at the interview notes and see how many people recommended to move forward and how many people said no.\",\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWER:\\nI have a slightly backpedaling question, just to touch on the finalists that you all forego for a certain role. When you keep them in the system, is there some kind of demarcation that says they passed through certain rounds of interview, or are recruiters that are handling reaching out to them in the future aware of how much screening they've gone through the company?\",\n",
       " 'INTERVIEWER:\\nOh, we definitely have time. This is very, very cool for us.',\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWEE:\\nI know, I was late, so we're good. I'll give you guys the five minutes you deserve if you have time.\",\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWER:\\nGotcha. Okay, we've definitely seen that as to be pretty integral to your jobs. Oh, and I just want to be respectful of your time, because I know we've blocked out only 15 minutes.\",\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWEE:\\nThat's a good question. Anyone can do the recruitment job. Not everyone will be successful. And the reason that's the case is because in recruitment you do have to be personal, you do have to pay attention to detail, and you have to communicate well. The reasons recruiters fail is because they're not paying attention to detail, they don't like to talk to people, they don't like to communicate with people, and they lack the response time. So to be a successful recruiter, you really just have to be someone who is able to come in and read job descriptions and understand what the role is, talk to the hiring manager, and ask clarifying questions if you don't understand the role fully so you can really understand what this role is going to do, how it's going to operate, so you can articulate that back into layman terms for a candidate that's applying for the position or that you're sourcing. So really, for a recruiter, you don't have to, but it's probably best for you to start as a sourcer. So if you're coming straight out of college, I would suggest going into a recruiting coordinator to a sourcer to a recruiter role or from college to a sourcer to a recruiter. You can jump, again, straight into a recruiter role, but the sourcing aspect of it at least lets you really hone in on the job description, start reviewing, start asking questions, like what does this abbreviation mean or what does this mean or why did you say, like what does roll up your sleeves mean to you, because a phrase may mean something to you that is completely different to me or I may have a more extreme view of it than what you do. So you really have to ask those types of questions and be inquisitive to your hiring team and partner with them, understand who they want, what type of profiles that they're doing and want to move forward with in the interview process, and then be able to articulate that back to someone and be able to change your approach, because you have to identify with each individual you're talking to. And be able to take unconscious bias out, right? You have to understand what your biases are and you have to be able to take those and throw them out the window, and if you're second-guessing, if you can do that, you need to pass that candidate to another recruiter who can, so that way everyone has a fair chance. So I think really when it comes to being a successful recruiter, it's about your ability to pay attention to detail and your ability to be self-aware, communicate well, and respond.\",\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWER:\\nOkay, lovely. It's good to hear. Yeah, and this is kind of like a little sideline, but something that we've been trying to understand is how are recruiters assessed? What does it mean to be a good recruiter?\",\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWEE:\\nYeah, that does happen. I couldn't give you guys any percentages or anything from that perspective based off of confidentiality within the company, but it does happen and when that happens and candidates make it through, because a lot of times, I mean, that's going to happen more often than not, because in most cases you're going to have two finalists. So one's going to get the job and one's not typically by the end of it. And that doesn't always happen. You don't always have two finalists, but sometimes you're at least going to have two finalists or you're just going to have the one. So someone's always at some point going to not make it through. So me and my team do communicate that with the team. We follow up with the candidate, let them know that unfortunately we're not moving forward. And if we're able to give feedback, we provide additional feedback if we received it, which in most cases we do, and just let them know. And a lot of times it just came down to two people, and at the end of the day, one just had a little bit of extra of this than the other one did. So we let them know, and then we keep them in the pipeline for future opportunities. So we'll stay connected with them, and they also stay connected with us on LinkedIn for the most part, so we can connect back with them whenever there's another opportunity. Or if as they see opportunity on our site that interests them, they'll reach out to us and let us know as well.\",\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWER:\\nGotcha. Yeah. Well, I mean it obviously reflects in how your sourcing works, how successful it is. Yeah, specifically about the recruitment pipeline actually. Do you all have candidates that make it through the screening process and are at the very end? And they're still candidates, but they don't end up getting hired? And what do you do with them if you do that?\",\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWEE:\\nYeah, it's really good. I mean, a lot of that comes, so our average workforce is around 30 to 35. So we have a lot of young workforce. So when we do hire in that 20 percent, and that is a rough estimate, don't quote 09 as that in any articles or anything for that effect. Just use it for your own research. But essentially, and your project essentially, essentially like when we're bringing college students, 09 does have a really great culture because we are about molding and growing our employees and we don't put you in a box. So we are a startup company, which means, and we do have 2,000 employees across the globe, so we're a startup that has a big amount of employees now with some good funding. So we don't put people in boxes. So if people are coming in, hitting the ground running and performing, then they're kind of growing within the company pretty quickly as well. So it gives people the ability to really learn more than just what they sign up for essentially. It gives them the opportunity to scale and then grow and get the promotion.\",\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWER:\\nGotcha. I got to say that's actually really impressive. We were talking with Marcus Dubois. He was a lead recruiter at Reddit. He said the ideal for a company of especially your size, like to get to 30 percent referrals is pretty astonishing. It's kind of a reflection of your company culture. That's pretty atypical.\",\n",
       " \"INTERVIEWEE:\\nYeah, so I would say about 30 to 35 percent of our hires are referred candidates. And then I, which is not necessarily the normal answer you'll get from a lot of people, because I've worked at other organizations where five to 10 percent have come from referrals, or there's other organizations where all of them come. It depends on how large the company is. But 30 to 35 percent of 09's employees come from referrals. And then LinkedIn is probably the bulk of the remainder. Well, LinkedIn is a portion. I don't have a rough estimate, but I would say we probably find, I'll say we'll probably find 20 percent from colleges and universities through internships and going through Handshake and different areas for the entry level roles, but then the other 50 percent is going to come from LinkedIn for the most part.\",\n",

But LinkedIn Recruiter is the one that we utilize. We have a license with LinkedIn per recruiter, so that way they can go in and source. So we do different Boolean searches. That's where we post our jobs as well for people to apply. So that's one area is LinkedIn. We have utilized other sources. We've utilized Indeed Some. That doesn't necessarily work as much for our type of roles that we're looking for, but it is one that we've utilized. We work with Glassdoor Some, and then we work with other sites here and there. One thing I've utilized has been Hired.com or DICE for the technical roles. LinkedIn is the main source and referrals. We do a lot of employee referrals too.

So, I also lead a team, but I am recruiting as well. So, from a day-to-day perspective, it does change. But for the most part, I'm having meetings with business leaders. I am having meetings with candidates to talk about interest, whether they be candidates that I'm having prospective conversations with. Maybe I don't have a role open. Maybe I do. And it's one of those where I'm just trying to understand who they are as a person. So, I can network and pipeline and have my pipeline built up to reach out to them when I do have opportunity. Or I have roles open where I'm headhunting and sourcing talent specifically to a position and trying to essentially qualify them for the role to send it forward for the interview process. And then I manage the interview process. So, I speak with the candidates on a daily basis, depending on where they're at or on a weekly basis, to get them through the process. And then I'm offering candidates. I'm getting them through the onboarding process with our onboarding team, getting them started here at O9, making sure that they're having a good experience overall. Having one-on-ones with my employees, developing them and mentoring them. So, from a day to day, it does change, but that kind of encompasses a lot of it as a whole. We also, O9 is expanding, so we're building up new regions. And in South America, we're working on launching Brazil. So, we're working on getting our legal entities set up and then staffing people. So, I also work with Employer Records, which is essentially an agency that payrolls our employees at O9 until we get a legal entity, and then we bring them over to be O9 employees. So, they're contractors, essentially, until they become employees.\",\n",

So when we do hire in that 20 percent, and that is a rough estimate, don't quote 09 as that in any articles or anything for that effect. Just use it for your own research. But essentially, and your project essentially, essentially like when we're bringing college students, 09 does have a really great culture because we are about molding and growing our employees and we don't put you in a box. So we are a startup company, which means, and we do have 2,000 employees across the globe, so we're a startup that has a big amount of employees now with some good funding. So we don't put people in boxes. So if people are coming in, hitting the ground running and performing, then they're kind of growing within the company pretty quickly as well.

I'm extremely curious because when you're saying that it's not so often in in-house recruiting to share candidates, something that we were kind of getting feedback on is when people have their own like trust and network of maybe other recruiters or people in the hiring space, they might talk to each other about, you know, once you have that kind of report with somebody, you trust their judgment on people. Do you tend to tap into those kind of networks or contribute to that?\n",
      "0.36225929856300354 INTERVIEWER:\n",
      "I see. And from a personal level, I definitely understand, especially with what you're saying, building relationship and such, to forward someone's information for a role that you think they might be good at. So, you know, generally, does this phenomenon occur somewhat frequently in your experience?\n",
      "\n",
      "INTERVIEWEE:\n",
      "It does happen with strong candidates. So I will I mean, I've reached out to it doesn't happen like very like it happens frequently for certain recruiters, especially agency recruiters. So let me take this back. In-house recruiters won't do that. Agent received recruiters will share information with other companies because they're working with other companies. So they'll say, hey, I have this candidate and gives a brief overview. And then if they agree to speak with them, they'll reach out to that candidate and ask if they can share their name and contact details and move forward from there. So if you're looking at agencies and RPOs, which is recruitment outsource process agencies, then they will share with multiple companies. If you're talking about an in-house agent and not in-house agency, an in-house corporate recruiting team like myself, we would not share our information, any candidate information with other companies. I may tell someone, hey, I had a great candidate. Let me reach out to them. And then I'll reach out to that candidate and say, hey, I know it didn't work out at 09. I have a friend that's recruiting for this role. I think you could be a good fit. Can I connect the two of you? That does happen more frequently than not. But I would say it's probably it depends on the recruiter. So if I was to put a percentage to it, I could see it happening 5 percent, 10 percent of the time, depending on who you're working with and how great that candidate is. But it happens very frequently with agencies because they're working with multiple companies.\n",
      "0.3562523126602173 INTERVIEWER:\n",
      "Gotcha. Yeah. Well, I mean it obviously reflects in how your sourcing works, how successful it is. Yeah, specifically about the recruitment pipeline actually. Do you all have candidates that make it through the screening process and are at the very end? And they're still candidates, but they don't end up getting hired? And what do you do with them if you do that?\n",
      "\n",
      "INTERVIEWEE:\n",
      "Yeah, that does happen. I couldn't give you guys any percentages or anything from that perspective based off of confidentiality within the company, but it does happen and when that happens and candidates make it through, because a lot of times, I mean, that's going to happen more often than not, because in most cases you're going to have two finalists. So one's going to get the job and one's not typically by the end of it. And that doesn't always happen. You don't always have two finalists, but sometimes you're at least going to have two finalists or you're just going to have the one. So someone's always at some point going to not make it through. So me and my team do communicate that with the team. We follow up with the candidate, let them know that unfortunately we're not moving forward. And if we're able to give feedback, we provide additional feedback if we received it, which in most cases we do, and just let them know. And a lot of times it just came down to two people, and at the end of the day, one just had a little bit of extra of this than the other one did. So we let them know, and then we keep them in the pipeline for future opportunities. So we'll stay connected with them, and they also stay connected with us on LinkedIn for the most part, so we can connect back with them whenever there's another opportunity.

Some just decide that after they do their job, they're going home unless there's like a great candidate. So let me take that back. Sharing within. So sharing talent within the company happens a lot. So if I have a role and then let's say John Doe over here, I'm just making up a recruiter name. That's yeah. Then I could say, hey, this candidate looks like they're actually a better fit for your role. The team didn't want to move forward because of X, Y, Z. And we will interject internally.

      "So, yeah, actually, I learned a lot from that. What I realized is that the way the technical people are assessed is completely different from the way that recruiters are assessed. In fact, I would say a lot of recruiters are assessed on qualitative data, like basically like subjective like, oh, here's this this this and even this company that's 2000 people, their assessment is like, not very like hard.\n",

      "Yeah, it seems like it's just up to opinions, which is kind of interesting. Let's see. Okay, that's interesting. I'm just like, I was just thinking about how how recruiter evaluated how we give bonuses to them because I want to know if there's even internal incentive alignment. I think what I realized after talking to all these people is that they also want an internal talent marketplace, like something that we could do is that we can make it so everybody or every recruiter and organization is in their own little bubble by default in a workspace.\n",

But if you really think about it like there has to be a human element to it because if you get especially with all the scams and things that go on in this world. So think about it from this perspective. I would say like if you guys were applying for a job when you graduate and you never actually spoke with anyone until you started or until you started your onboarding paperwork. How do you know that it's a legit company? First and foremost, like you've never spoken with anyone. How do you know the true culture of the company at this point? I think there is ways to automate. Like I think there's a lot of ways that could be enhanced, like a lot more self scheduling automation and a lot more like email, different pieces that can go through. But I think that what wins people into companies is what they experienced through the recruitment onboarding process. I've had at least five candidates in the last month to tell me that they wouldn't have joined 09 if it wasn't for our recruitment process because they selected us over other companies because we were the people that responded the fastest communicated the best and was transparent with them throughout. And I think that makes the difference in why someone would select us over our competitors.\n",

Do you all do to maybe assign bonuses or some like promotions or whatnot? Or is it more subjective?\n",
      "\n",
      "INTERVIEWEE:\n",
      "Yeah, there is some subjective pieces. However, we do have metrics that a lot of recruiters as a whole, especially us, we're looking at our time to fill. We're looking at how many submissions we've submitted. So like how like and we look at time to fill to understand, not as a metric to be like we have to get shorter timeframes. It's sometimes that is for like our interview process is too long. Let's cut this down because this is how fast we like. We're losing talent because we're going too slow. We utilize those metrics. But we also look at how many people were submitting to the hiring team. We're looking at diversity and inclusion. How many diverse candidates are we submitting in as a whole? And if we're not, why aren't we? What do we need to do to change that? We look at metrics as far as how many people accept our offers to decline and why is that so we can improve it on our end as a company as a whole. So there are a lot of different metrics that we look at. But the big ones for us is our diversity inclusion, because it's something we're ramping up here at 09. It's also are essentially like looking at how fast or how slow we're filling roles so we can improve the process for the candidate and also be able to bring in better talent faster. But qualifying and then essentially how many people we are submitting over to the team and how much we're not like. And why is that? Is it because the talent pool is very minimal? And then we go look at reports and we pull different research data that shows us like we're trying to hire for a purple squirrel and there's only about 3% within this area. Let's expand our area or we need to reduce the requirements of the position. We look at different requirements, I mean different metrics like that.\n",

      "You're not allowed to do that. It's against the law. It's a confidentiality breach without asking the candidate first. So you could ask the candidate like, hey, this role didn't work out, but I have a friend who's hiring this. Would you be OK with me sharing your contact details with them? And if they state yes, then we can. But if a candidate applies internally to someone's company, they should not be sharing it outside, because when someone applies, we're saying that we're keeping this information internal for you. And that is the way it is legally supposed to happen.\n",

      "Alright, perfect. Well, I'm Courtney. I am a senior recruiting manager here at O9 Solutions. So, I've been with O9 for about a year now, but managing the overall recruitment for all of the Americas within our company.\n",
      "0.25038397312164307 INTERVIEWEE:\n",
      "That's a good question. Anyone can do the recruitment job. Not everyone will be successful. And the reason that's the case is because in recruitment you do have to be personal, you do have to pay attention to detail, and you have to communicate well. The reasons recruiters fail is because they're not paying attention to detail, they don't like to talk to people, they don't like to communicate with people, and they lack the response time. So to be a successful recruiter, you really just have to be someone who is able to come in and read job descriptions and understand what the role is, talk to the hiring manager, and ask clarifying questions if you don't understand the role fully so you can really understand what this role is going to do, how it's going to operate, so you can articulate that back into layman terms for a candidate that's applying for the position or that you're sourcing. So really, for a recruiter, you don't have to, but it's probably best for you to start as a sourcer. So if you're coming straight out of college, I would suggest going into a recruiting coordinator to a sourcer to a recruiter role or from college to a sourcer to a recruiter. You can jump, again, straight into a recruiter role, but the sourcing aspect of it at least lets you really hone in on the job description, start reviewing, start asking questions, like what does this abbreviation mean or what does this mean or why did you say, like what does roll up your sleeves mean to you, because a phrase may mean something to you that is completely different to me or I may have a more extreme view of it than what you do. So you really have to ask those types of questions and be inquisitive to your hiring team and partner with them, understand who they want, what type of profiles that they're doing and want to move forward with in the interview process, and then be able to articulate that back to someone and be able to change your approach, because you have to identify with each individual you're talking to. And be able to take unconscious bias out, right? You have to understand what your biases are and you have to be able to take those and throw them out the window, and if you're second-guessing, if you can do that, you need to pass that candidate to another recruiter who can, so that way everyone has a fair chance. So I think really when it comes to being a successful recruiter, it's about your ability to pay attention to detail and your ability to be self-aware, communicate well, and respond.\n",

      "Gotcha. So it's from what I hear like the most quantitative metrics would be like the number of people in the number of people hired and the number of people who accept it.\n",
      "\n",
      "INTERVIEWEE:\n",
      "So it's like the conversion on all those. Interesting. Now if you talk to like high volume people or agency, they may be looking at how many phone calls have went out. They may be looking at how many submissions there are too but they're going to be more so looking at like how many people are you calling? How many people have you emailed? How many people here? How many people? So there are recruiting teams that are a little bit more heavy metric driven where we're not as focused on the number of how many people you're speaking to. We're more concerned with the quality of hires that we're making and retaining at the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "INTERVIEWER:\n",
      "Gotcha. And Michelle had a really good question about the leadership. I kind of forgot it.\n",
      "\n",
      "INTERVIEWER:\n",
      "Oh yeah. I was going to say because I've been listening to some human resource podcast recently and I've been just curious about personal differences in leadership philosophy. So something about your role that I'm seeing feels like you know there's certainly a huge management element to it. I was just wondering kind of like what is your way of leading like efficient quality hiring and what what kind of sets your leadership apart in that.\n",
      "0.18336279690265656 INTERVIEWER:\n",
      "I have a slightly backpedaling question, just to touch on the finalists that you all forego for a certain role. When you keep them in the system, is there some kind of demarcation that says they passed through certain rounds of interview, or are recruiters that are handling reaching out to them in the future aware of how much screening they've gone through the company?\n",
      "\n",
      "INTERVIEWEE:\n",
      "Yes, ideally that doesn't happen at every company, but yes, there is a record that's kept. Now, what I will say is you can't necessarily keep people in the system too long, depending on what location you're in, because there are GDPR rules in other countries, and then in the US there's OFCCP. So in the US we can retain application details a little bit longer, but if you're like in Europe or other countries, you have to remove candidate data after a year, and then you have to also give them the ability in any place really to be able to delete their data as well. So candidates can have the option to ask you to remove their data or to opt out of you retaining whatever details. Depending on the location. So for us, we do have that detail though. So for candidates that are active and are within the platform that we're retaining their information on, we retain the data of the interview notes and feedback that the hiring team completed, and then we do our best to make sure that we put a little bit more depth in there on the reasoning why we didn't move forward with someone. Sometimes it is kind of a typical like, did not meet the qualifications or someone more qualified was selected, but a good recruiter does notate. Didn't move forward with them, nothing wrong with the profile, just XYZ from the other candidate. So that way it's good to re-circle back to. A lot of recruiters will add people on LinkedIn and stay up to date with them and interact with them on their feeds as well. But yes, like if I left and one of my recruiters seen a candidate that had been in my process, they'd be able to look at the interview notes and see how many people recommended to move forward and how many people said no.\n",
      "0.18244504928588867 INTERVIEWEE:\n",
      "So, like, my workday as a whole? Yeah, so with O9, my workday is as a leader within the Americas. I'm typically a hands-on recruiter too. So, I also lead a team, but I am recruiting as well. So, from a day-to-day perspective, it does change. But for the most part, I'm having meetings with business leaders. I am having meetings with candidates to talk about interest, whether they be candidates that I'm having prospective conversations with. Maybe I don't have a role open. Maybe I do. And it's one of those where I'm just trying to understand who they are as a person. So, I can network and pipeline and have my pipeline built up to reach out to them when I do have opportunity. Or I have roles open where I'm headhunting and sourcing talent specifically to a position and trying to essentially qualify them for the role to send it forward for the interview process. And then I manage the interview process. So, I speak with the candidates on a daily basis, depending on where they're at or on a weekly basis, to get them through the process. And then I'm offering candidates. I'm getting them through the onboarding process with our onboarding team, getting them started here at O9, making sure that they're having a good experience overall. Having one-on-ones with my employees, developing them and mentoring them. So, from a day to day, it does change, but that kind of encompasses a lot of it as a whole. We also, O9 is expanding, so we're building up new regions. And in South America, we're working on launching Brazil. So, we're working on getting our legal entities set up and then staffing people. So, I also work with Employer Records, which is essentially an agency that payrolls our employees at O9 until we get a legal entity, and then we bring them over to be O9 employees. So, they're contractors, essentially, until they become employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "INTERVIEWER:\n",
      "Totally get that. Wow, that's a lot to do in a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "INTERVIEWEE:\n",
      "Yeah. It isn't, I mean, that's essentially, like, my day-to-day's involved, blends of all of those pieces. But for the most part, it's responding to emails and meetings and sourcing people. Lovely. Good to hear.\n",
      "0.17159679532051086 INTERVIEWEE:\n",
      "Yes. A good question. For me I'm someone who is probably more transparent than most managers. I think that being transparent and I'm like that with candidates too because I think transparency is key. But I'm very hands off but hands on with my employees. So the way that I manage is essentially I do have weekly one on ones that with my team and we talk through what challenges and successes that they're having. If they make a mistake we talk through that mistake. It's not an automatic counseling or anything. It's just like oh hey you know you made a mistake. Here's what you can do to improve. If that continues to happen then we have more direct conversations where I'm like hey we talked about this five minute five times already. I'm going to start documenting it because you are missing X Y Z and there's been no room for improvement. If this doesn't continue then I'll start the documentation process. So I give them a heads up before I ever start that process anyways and I think that's what's different. I think some managers will start that process after the second or third time and not give a heads up. They'll just say hey you're not doing X Y Z and they'll start documenting and move forward that process. I don't do that so I don't necessarily have as much turnover on my team or performance management issues on my team because I have flexibility with my team too. Like I don't care what time they start working. I don't care what time they end their day as long as they're performing and meeting their expectations and deadlines with the hiring managers and hiring teams. So I really lead by getting feedback from my team on how I can better assist them understanding what they need. Some of my employees will need me to meet with them two times a week or some of my employees want to change our weekly to a biweekly because that's more efficient for them with other meetings that they have going on and I'm flexible and adapt to those pieces as long as we're performing. If we're not performing then that's where I pull in a little bit more and I become more hands on and more focused and and so forth. But we work together as a team. It's more of a partnership than meeting their leader. It's more of a we work together as a team. How can we support each other?\n",

      "Gotcha. Well, I mean something that we were initially thinking like we're all technical people with technical backgrounds.
